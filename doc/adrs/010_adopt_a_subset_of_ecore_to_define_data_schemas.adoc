= ADR-010 - Adopt a subset of Ecore to define data schemas for modelers

== Context

We will need a way for modeler authors to describe their business domain as a "metamodel".
For the first MVP, we will define a simple version with just the minimum features needed to define simple data schema.
We do not want to use the same terminology as in EMF or MDA/MDE in general ("model", "metamodel", "EClass"):
* outside of the (relatively small) modeling community, these terms can be seen negatively, and associated to e.g. UML;
* we want Sirius Web to be able to attract users from other communities who are not familiar with this terminology (and can be "scared" by terms like "metamodel");
* while we will probably rely on EMF at first for the implementation, we want to be free in the future to diverge from EMF and support other kinds of data sources.

== Decision

```ts
// In pseudo-code (TypeScript type signatures)
// Alternative names: Namespace, Domain
interface Schema {
    name: string;
    uri: string;
    types: Entity[];
}

// Alternative names: Class, Type, Concept
interface Entity {
    name: string;
    attributes: Attribute[];
    relations: Relation[];
}

// Alternative names: Property
interface Attribute {
    name: string;
    type: 'string' | 'boolean' | 'number';
    // cardinality hard-coded to "1" for now
}

// Alternative names: Reference
interface Relation {
    name: string;
    containment: boolean;
    targetTypes: Entity[];
    // cardinality hard-coded to "*" for now
}
```

=== Implementation

To simplify the implementation we will rely on Ecore, both at runtime and for the serialisation, but this should be seen as an implementation detail invisible to modeler authors, and is subject to change later on.

== Status

Draft.
